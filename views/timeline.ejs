        Since the signing of HB2, North Carolina has yet to leave the center of attention. The law has not only caused the LGBTQ community to express their anger and discomfort, but has also made economic impacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Large businesses have threatened to move elsewhere unless the law is overturned. The loss of such business is a huge hit on the N.C. economy and loses thousands of dollars and jobs if moved. These businesses include Apple, Fox, American Airlines, Bank of America, Dow and more.  The list also extends to sporting associations. The NBA and NCAA have both made public statements against HB2 and have threatened to not allow any post-season sporting events to occur in the state. Notably, the NBA planned to have the 2017 All-star game in Charlotte, but is now considering a different location.

        The biggest hit on N.C. from HB2 is arguably the music industry. Numerous musicians have since cancelled their shows in the state and are still continuing to do so.
